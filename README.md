# productOrdering
Your task is to simulate a product listing page like you would find on Etsy, Amazon, or Ebay. This application should implement the following features:

1. Display an individual product component. Each product should have a title, short description, price, quantity, and an          image.
2. Display the application information in a navigation bar at the top of the page.
3. The name of the company
4. Three links: Categories, Orders, and Log Out (_these links won't actually do anything, you're just practicing making the      navigation bar a component)
5. Display a review list component that contains product review components beneath a product.
